--- step 1: 

generate some input files

$ generateInput.py

have a look at the result

$ ls input



--- step 2: 

make the drawHist scripts available in your path

$ setenv.sh                

you might want to copy the content of setenve into your .bashrc



--- step 3

weight your files

$ weightHist.py

the integrated luminosity is taken from lumi.txt
the cross sections and preselection efficiencies are taken from xsection.txt
the number of generated events that pass preselection efficiency are taken from the first bin in the histogram under input/*.root:counts



--- step 4:

test the drawing of a stack

$ drawHist.py

check out the result

$ ls input_weighted_drawn

check out the configuration file drawRules.cfg

--- step 5:

test the drawing of normalised shapes 

$ drawHist.py --drawrules=drawRules_shapes.cfg --odir=input_weighted_drawn_shapes --force

check out the result

$ ls input_weighted_drawn_shapes

check out the configuration file drawRules_shapes.cfg
