tools for automatized weighting and drawing of histograms


-------------------------------------------
 weighting histograms with weightHist.py
-------------------------------------------

the directory contains all ingredients for a working example:
$ ./weightHist.py

Histograms are read from root files in an input directory (option --idir).
They are weighted with L*eff*xsec/N,
where L is read from a txt fil (option --lumifile), 
or where L is given as command line argument (option --lumi),
and where eff and xsec are read from txt file (option --xsecfile).
For N, the script takes the content of the first bin of the 'count histogram' 
(option --countHistPath)
The weighted histograms are written to root files in a new output directory (option --odir).
The output root files have identical names and identical stucture as the input root files.

-------------------------------------------
 draw histograms with drawHist.py
-------------------------------------------

The directory contains all ingredients for a working example.
First, run the example in the previous section, then:
$ ./drawHist.py

Historgrams are read from root files in an input directory (option --idir).
They are drawn according to 'draw rules' specified in a cfg file (option --drawCfg).
The script assumes that each input root file represents a different sample,
and that all input root files have the exact same file structure of directories and histograms.
(see further for exceptions) 
The script walks recursively through the file structure of the input files,
and draws each histogram as specified in the draw rules.
The resulting canvasses are saved in the prefered format (option --oformat),
in a new output directory (optoin --odir),
that has the the same structure of subdirectories as the input files.

The language of the draw rules cfg files is explained in drawRules.cfg.

If one only wants to consider a particular histogram in the file structure,
or histograms in a particular directory, the path to this histogram or directory
can be specified as a command line option (option --histpath=HISTPATH)
The structure of the input files must only be identical within this path.

Layout options specific to particular histograms in the input file structure,
are specified in a hist cfg file (option --histcfg).
See histCfg.cfg for syntax.
